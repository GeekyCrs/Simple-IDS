# **App Name**: CanteenConnect

## Core Features:

- User Authentication & Roles: User authentication with signup, sign-in, persistent sessions, password reset (including 'forgot password' functionality), and role-based access control (chef, manager, client).
- Menu & Order Management: Daily meal posting by chef, including price, triggering push notifications to users for order confirmation. Menu management (add, update, delete items and prices) by chef and manager.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming green (#4CAF50) to evoke feelings of freshness and health associated with food.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds to provide a clean and modern look.
- Accent: Use orange (#FF9800) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons to draw attention.
- Clean and readable font for main content.
- Simple, intuitive icons for menu items and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout for menu items and order summaries.

## Original User Request:
I want to build a small apk cross platform (for both mac and windows, android and iOS)
to manage a canteen at work and make it easier for people to order meals or check their monthly bill
I want that each user can sign up, sign in, change his password(forget password feature) Once signed in, they will be permanently signed in unless they choose to log out
roles will be chef , manager and clients (users) 
The canteen chef will post daily what he has for daily meal , when he posts it (with the price) the users will get notifications on their devices when clicked they will get a message box to choose to count them in on lunch or not
everyone is able to see the menu in their dashboard (the menu is retrieved from the database),
the manager and chef can update the menu (items and prices and qtt) 
For stock management, also manager and chef can manage the stock

The user can only make orders (the same as menu but in checklist) with custom made modifications as notes when ordered, and add dinner time (when the user wants to eat) the chefs only gets a notification on his device and the order adds to queue

after he makes his order (the price of the item gets added to his bill) 
so that the user can see his bill, based on everything he ordered from the canteen (dinner , daily meal, beverage, dessert,breakfast....)
EACH USER CAN ONLY SEE HIS BILLS and orders, only managers can see everyone's bills to keep track
and the user can access his order history (also the manager) for billing reviews
CAN YOU DO IT FOR ME IN THE EASIEST LANGUAGE CROSS PLATFORM
